# Tech Stack

The [Convex](https://convex.dev/) database platform is the backbone of the app. It provides the single source of truth used by all clients.

The default client is a React app deployed to Vercel. Routing is provided by Tanstack-router using file-based routing. Data sync is provided by Convex. User registration and auth is provided by Clerk.

Documentation will be hosted by Vercel on an Astro-generated site using Starlight.
We will provide an onboarding tutorial for every new user of the app.
Eventually, we will provide guides for users of advanced features.
