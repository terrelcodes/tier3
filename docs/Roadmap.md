# Value Roadmap

## Product Vision

To provide a gentle path for users who want to start managing their time well.
Allow them to start small and grow to professional level project management.

## Product Value

* Provide a single place to keep task lists and time sheets.
* Provide a simple workflow for tracking time spent on tasks.

## Release Plans

The MVP will be released not later than 24 August 2025.
This corresponds to the Solo Project deadline for Chingu Voyage 57.
This release will include all code and documentation to support
the requirements of a Tier 3 project. It will also be what I use
to manage all of my personal projects moving forward. I will offer
it as a tool to my Chingu team.
